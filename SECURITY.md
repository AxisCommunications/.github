## Security advisories & vulnerability archive

Axis follows industry best practices in managing and responding to security vulnerabilities in our products to minimize customers risk of exposure. Axis cannot guarantee that products and services are free from flaws that may be exploited for malicious attacks. Therefore we monitor known vulnerabilities referred to as CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure). CVEs that Axis identify as critical or caused by Axis will be prioritized and often announced with a [Security Advisory](https://www.axis.com/stay-secure). The vulnerability archive transparently lists both OpenSource and Axis vulnerabilities that have been brought to our attention.
